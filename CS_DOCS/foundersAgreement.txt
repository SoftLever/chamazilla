Measuring the value
How many customers are there?
How much are they willing to pay for the service?

Creation of new shares
Shares are created for investors

For instance, if the company is valued at ksh1,000,000 and an investor raises ksh300,000

(300000/1000000)*100 = 30%

30% more stocks ( 300000) are created and issued to the investor.

So now the investor owns (300,000/1,300,000)% of the company - 23%
