Business Model

1.Subscriptions
The main source of revenue for Chama Smart will be monthly group subscriptions. Each group with less than 20 members will be charged a fixed fee of ksh200 a month and each with members above 20, according to the following equation;

	y = 5x + 100

Where y is the amount chama smart charges, and is determined by x, the number of members in a group. 


2. Manual Record Manipulation
Chama Smart is built to have as few features as possible to maintain simplicity. Therefore, some functionalities like assigning roles are unavailable. However, database admins will be able to manipulate records on behalf of chamas at a fee. For example, changing the phone number of the Chama representative (the person who authenticates on behalf of the chama) will requiere a fee of ksh 50.

Scalability
Chama Smart is a scalable business. The revenue made will depend on the number of Chamas that are subscribed to the service. The more the groups, the more the revenue.
